                    For my Navigational Interfaces course, we were tasked with redesigning
                    a companies site that had poor usability. This project started with
                    paper prototypes and low fidelty wireframes. From there we preformed
                    several rounds of user testing to identify issues with the original site
                    and with our new proposed design.

                <p class="p">
                    The data I collected form user testing helped clarify existing problems
                    with the CTA site. The redesign aimed to improve usability by creating a clear
                    visual heiarchy, providing the most important tools first, and eliminating 
                    unnecessary content.

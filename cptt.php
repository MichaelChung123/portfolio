                    For my Interactive Ad Campaign course, we worked with Child's Play Touring
                    Theatre, a not-for-profit organization aimed at teaching children about
                    writing and acting.

                <p class="p">
                    Our goal was to provide CPTT with a website they could manage on their own, 
                    make their site mobile friendly (CPTT's old site was unusable on anything but a desktop),
                    and completely restructure the site to improve usability.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    I oversaw the entire project, working with a team of copywriters, a 
                    social media team, and a documentation team.

                    As a midterm project for my Emergent Web Technologies course, we were
                    tasked with redesigning our Columbia department's page from scratch.
                    The layout of the redesign to be coded by hand, had to be developed for mobile first,
                    and had to be responsive without excluding any content from the Interactive Arts & Media department
                    page.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    Utilizing progressive enhancement, larger screens provided the same content
                    as mobile, but just provided more of it (such as number of event posts, number
                    of student art pieces showcased). 
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    For images, the redesign used <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Picturefill</a> to serve appropriate image sizes
                    depending on screen size.
